            worked with 2 startups in "Shiraz startup factory" to ensure their
            libraries type safety and polished their frontend to be pixel
            perfect and have industry level standards and minimize discrepancies
            before presenting to investors.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          implemented continuous integration with "github actions" and end to
          end testing with "playwright" for a project I helped to start with
          docker, supabase and react.
