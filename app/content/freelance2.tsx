        <li>
          worked with 2 startups in "Shiraz startup factory" to ensure their
          libraries type safety and polished their frontend to be pixel perfect
          and have industry level standards and minimize discrepancies before
          presenting to investors.
        </li>
        <li>
          implemented continuous integration with "github actions" and end to
          end testing with "playwright" for a project I helped to start with
          docker, supabase and react.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        with writing unit tests, using storybook.js and migrating from redux to
        redux toolkit, median time to design and develop components was improved
        by 20%.
